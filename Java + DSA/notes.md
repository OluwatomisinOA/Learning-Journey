### DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

- Data Structure is the way we store and organize data.

# Classification of Data Structure
1. Linear Data structure
 > Static Data structure
  - Array
 > Dynamic Data structure
  - Queue
  - Stack
  - Linked List
2. Non-Linear Data structure
 > Tree
 > Graph

 # What is Algorithm?
 - Algorithm is following step by step to complete certain procedure and achieve an expected outcome.

 # How do we judge an algorithm ?
 1. Accuracy: if it is exactly doing what it is supposed to do.
 2. Time Cmomplexity: is how much longer will it take for you to complete your algorithm or your tasks if the number of inputs keep on growing larger. 
 - Linear Time Complexity Big O or O(N): the time it takes for it to complete the expected task increases with the increase in the inputs. 
 Ex: Find a card in random cards.
 - Logarithmic Time Complexity O(Logn): with every task or every step we make, we are essentialy eliminating 50% of all the inputs in one go.
 Ex: Find a card in sorted cards.
 - Constant Time Complexity O(1): (is the most basic time complexity).
 - O(N²) Time Complexity : is basically the matching between two separate text.
